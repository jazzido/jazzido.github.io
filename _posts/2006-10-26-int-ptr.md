> I&#8217;ve come to realize that understanding pointers in C is not a skill, it&#8217;s an aptitude. In first year computer science classes, there are always about 200 kids at the beginning of the semester, all of whom wrote complex adventure games in <span class="caps">BASIC</span> for their PCs when they were 4 years old. They are having a good ol&#8217; time learning C or Pascal in college, until one day they professor introduces pointers, and suddenly, they don&#8217;t get it. They just don&#8217;t understand anything any more. 90% of the class goes off and becomes Political Science majors, then they tell their friends that there weren&#8217;t enough good looking members of the appropriate sex in their CompSci classes, that&#8217;s why they switched. For some reason most people seem to be born without the part of the brain that understands pointers. Pointers require a complex form of doubly-indirected thinking that some people just can&#8217;t do, and it&#8217;s pretty crucial to good programming. A lot of the &#8220;script jocks&#8221; who started programming by copying JavaScript snippets into their web pages and went on to learn Perl never learned about pointers, and they can never quite produce code of the quality you need.
