[Cory Doctorow][1], escritor de ciencia ficciÃ³n y uno de los editores de [Boing Boing][2], sobre las convenciones sociales en las social networks:

> I think that&#8217;s why these services are so volatile: why we&#8217;re so willing to flee from Friendster and into MySpace&#8217;s loving arms; from MySpace to Facebook. It&#8217;s socially awkward to refuse to add someone to your friends list&#8212;but removing someone from your friend-list is practically a declaration of war.

> [&#8230;] a true story: a young woman, an elementary school teacher, joins Friendster after some of her Burning Man buddies send her an invite. All is well until her students sign up and notice that all the friends in her profile are sunburnt, drug-addled techno-pagans whose own profiles are adorned with digital photos of their painted genitals flapping over the Playa. The teacher inveigles her friends to clean up their profiles, and all is well again until her boss, the school principal, signs up to the service and demands to be added to her friends list. The fact that she doesn&#8217;t like her boss doesn&#8217;t really matter: in the social world of Friendster and its progeny, it&#8217;s perfectly valid to demand to be &#8220;friended&#8221; in an explicit fashion that most of us left behind in the fourth grade. Now that her boss is on her friends list, our teacher-friend&#8217;s buddies naturally assume that she is one of the tribe and begin to send her lascivious Friendster-grams, inviting her to all sorts of dirty funtimes. [&#8230;]
