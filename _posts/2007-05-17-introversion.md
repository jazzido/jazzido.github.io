> Extroverts [therefore] dominate public life. This is a pity. If we introverts ran the world, it would no doubt be a calmer, saner, more peaceful sort of place. As Coolidge is supposed to have said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know that four fifths of all our troubles in this life would disappear if we would just sit down and keep still?&#8221; (He is also supposed to have said, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t say anything, you won&#8217;t be called on to repeat it.&#8221; The only thing a true introvert dislikes more than talking about himself is repeating himself.)
