Citan a [Jaron Lanier][1] en [este post][2] de [Rhizome][3]:

> [&#8230;] sites like Facebook are nice if you&#8217;re over 25 and have a social history to mine, if you&#8217;re 15 then Facebook functions more like a continuous performance space where teens must constantly reinforce a superficial identity and navigate immature group dynamics, leaving no time for the introspection, self-cultivation, and self-invention (or reinvention) needed to become a real adult. Lanier posed the question if Robert Zimmerman had a Facebook profile, would he have internalized Woodie Guthrie, moved to Greenwich Village and renamed himself Bob Dylan? Probably not, he says, as everyone would know or find out he&#8217;s that Zimmerman guy from Michigan
