Una cita breve de [Adam Curtis][1], en su blog [The Medium and the Message][2]:

> In our age of individualism we see computers as ways through which we can express our individuality. But the truth is that the computers are really good at spotting the very opposite.
> 
> The computers can see how similar we are, and they then have the ability to agglomerate us together into groups that have the same behaviours. And from that they can predict what choices and decisions we will make.
> 
> And they do it solely through our observed behaviour.

Nada nuevo, pero no es malo acordarse.
